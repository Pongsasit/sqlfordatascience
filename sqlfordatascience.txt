Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000
select count(*)
from attribute;

ii. Business table =10000
select count(*)
from business;

iii. Category table = 10000
select count(*)
from category;

iv. Checkin table = 10000
select count(*)
from checkin;

v. elite_years table = 10000
select count(*)
from elite_years;

vi. friend table = 10000
select count(*)
from friend;

vii. hours table = 10000
slect count(*)
from hours;

viii. photo table = 10000
select count(*)
from photo;

ix. review table = 10000
select count(*)
from review;

x. tip table = 10000
select count(*)
from tip;

xi. user table = 10000
select count(*)
from user;	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business
id = 10000
select count(DISTINCT(id)
from business;

ii. Hours
business_id = 1562
select count(DISTINCT(business_id))

from hours;

iii. Category
business_id = 2643
select count(DISTINCT(business_id))
from category;

iv. Attribute 
business_id = 1115
select count(DISTINCT(business_id))
from attribute;

v. Review   
business_id =8090
id = 10000
user_id = 10000

select count(DISTINCT(business_id)),
count(DISTINCT(id)),
count(user_id)
from review ;

vi. Checkin  
business_id =493

select count(DISTINCT(business_id))
from checkin;

vii. Photo 
business_id = 6493
id = 10000

select count(DISTINCT(business_id)),
count(DISTINCT(id))
from photo;

viii. Tip 
user_id = 537
business_id = 3979
select count(DISTINCT(user_id)),
count(DISTINCT(business_id))
from tip;

ix. User  
id = 10000 
select count(DISTINCT(id))
from user;

x. Friend  
user_id = 11
friend_id = 9415

select count(DISTINCT(user_id)),
count(DISTINCT(friend_id))
from friend;

xi. Elite_years 
user_id = 2780

select count(DISTINCT(user_id))
from elite_years;
Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	

3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer: no

8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?
	No, after I used the code below, the result is that even if you have more review_count
your fans may less than the people who have the less review count as the table below has shown.
select id,

review_count,

fans

from user

order by fans desc ;
	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:

(Output limit exceeded, 25 of 10000 total rows shown)

So, "only" posing more review cannot infer that you will have more fans.	

	
9. Are there more reviews with the word "love" or with the word "hate" in them?

	Answer:Love(1780) more than hate (232)

	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:

	select count(*)
	
from review
	
where text like "%love%" ;
	the result is, I found 1780 words.
	
	select count(*)
	
from review
	
where text like "%hate%" ;
	the result is, I found 232 words.

	
10. Find the top 10 users with the most fans:

	SQL code used to arrive at answer:

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
Harald, Gerald, Fran, William, Christine are 5 people out of 10 of the top users who
still remain in the tp 10 users ranking with 2 types of order.
So I could infer that, (50%) medium relationship (or correlation) between having 
a high number of fans and being listed as "useful" or "funny."
	
	
	

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
	Yes. Most of 4,5 stars group have shorter hours than 2,3 stars group.
	(Data from 3 shopping places only)

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
	Yes. 4,5 stars group have 4 and 32 reviews, so the average of review of this group is 18 reviews.
	And 1 shopping place that is in 2,3 stars group have only 6 reviews.         
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
	89121,89118 have few reviews,
	89161 has lot of reviews
	After I search this postal code in google map, 89161 have bigger area than 89121 and 89118.
	So this may infer that people who live in this 89161 places are more than both with fewer reviews.

2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
         The open place's amount of reviews are higher than closed place.
   		(269300 reviews)			(35261 reviews)      
ii. Difference 2:
	The open place's average of stars are higher than closed place.
   		(3.67900943396 stars)			(3.52039473684 stars)

3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
	Find out the causes those are reasons for the shopping places those are still open in Las Vegas.
	By using data we got.
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
        I want to know and find out the relation of all shopping place those are still have is_open status (still open). So I start from finding much detailed data as I can.
Such, city, state and working hour and type of this shopping place.
	The results came out that only shopping place that still "open" in Las Vegas is the business that has attribute 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards,GoodForKids', which mean in Las Vegas
good for kids are valuable to do a business. Even if my image about Vegas is casino and shows, but belief in data, good for kids could be good and survival business too.                  
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
+------------------------+--------------------------------+-----------+-------+--------------+-------+--------------+---------------+-----------------+----------------+--------------+----------------+--------------+------------+----------------------------------------+---------+
| id                     | name                           | city      | state | review_count | stars | monday_hours | tuesday_hours | wednesday_hours | thursday_hours | friday_hours | saturday_hours | sunday_hours | categories | attributes                             | is_open |

			   B.city,

			   B.state,

			   B.review_count,

			   B.stars,
